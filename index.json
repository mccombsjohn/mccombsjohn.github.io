In this paper, WWD detection data from 48 toll road exit ramps were modeled to identify the factors that affect WWD frequency. The developed negative binomial model showed that exit ramps with more lanes, a toll booth, and higher crossing street volumes were predicted to have more WWD, whereas having more lanes on the opposing approach to the exit ramp was predicted to reduce WWD. Examination of 726 WWD detections showed that 23% were initiated by left-turning vehicles and 18% were initiated by right-turning vehicles, with significantly more left-turn entries occurring at night than right-turn entries (at $\\\\alpha = 0.05$). A case study of five ramps showed that exits with an extended median on the crossing road had fewer left-turn entries and exits with right-turn lanes on the crossing road had fewer right-turn entries. Lastly, radar, laser, and thermal WWD detection technologies were compared based on their WWD detections and false alarms. The laser sites had significantly more detections and false alarms than the radar sites (at $\\\\alpha = 0.05$), with the radar sites having a significantly higher WWD detection rate than false alarm rate. Radar false alarms were mainly caused by large trucks, whereas the laser sites had issues with equipment damage and traffic queues. The results of this paper can help agencies better understand WWD behavior and identify the most appropriate WWD detection technologies.","tags":"","title":"Using Wrong-Way Driving Detection Data to Identify Factors That Affect Wrong-Way Driving Behavior and Compare Detection Technologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John McCombs"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Because SPFs developed in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) only use data from certain states, several states have developed region-specific SPFs. However, these SPFs typically only utilize the three roadway categories in the HSM. This research developed SPFs based on a new context classification system used by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) which categorizes intersections into eight different categories. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB), zero-inflated Poisson, and hurdle models were developed and compared to the commonly used negative binomial (NB) and Poisson models for four context classification groups. To develop these context-specific SPFs, data for 29 variables were collected based on the Model Inventory of Roadway Elements 2.0, allowing for standard data collection across agencies. A statistically significant linear regression model (adjusted $R\\^2=0.684$) was built to predict missing minor AADT volumes. ZINB models outperformed the other models for the two unsignalized intersection groups, whereas NB models performed the best for the two signalized intersection groups. The influential variables differed for each group, showing how FDOT‚Äôs context classification system can identify specific crash-influencing factors for different classifications, helping agencies better reduce intersection crashes.","tags":"","title":"Developing Context-Specific Safety Performance Functions for Florida Intersections to More Accurately Predict Intersection Crashes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
