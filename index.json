[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My name is John McCombs, and I am a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering at the University of Central Florida. My research focuses on improving traffic operations and safety in Florida using statistical modeling and data science. Working with Professor Haitham Al-Deek, Ph.D., P.E., I have contributed to projects on preventing wrong-way driving on limited access facilities, developing safety performance functions for intersections, and analyzing the impacts of disabled and abandoned vehicles on limited access facilities. My most recent project, which is the subject of my Ph.D., is developing a corridor safety approach using both crash and non-crash data to identify high-risk suburban and urban roadways where crashes and fatalities can be reduced. In my spare time, I like to play video games, crochet, and explore American mid-century pop culture and media.\n","date":1647302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1647302400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/john-mccombs/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/john-mccombs/","section":"authors","summary":"My name is John McCombs, and I am a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering at the University of Central Florida.
