In this paper, WWD detection data from 48 toll road exit ramps were modeled to identify the factors that affect WWD frequency. The developed negative binomial model showed that exit ramps with more lanes, a toll booth, and higher crossing street volumes were predicted to have more WWD, whereas having more lanes on the opposing approach to the exit ramp was predicted to reduce WWD. Examination of 726 WWD detections showed that 23% were initiated by left-turning vehicles and 18% were initiated by right-turning vehicles, with significantly more left-turn entries occurring at night than right-turn entries (at $\\alpha = 0.05$). A case study of five ramps showed that exits with an extended median on the crossing road had fewer left-turn entries and exits with right-turn lanes on the crossing road had fewer right-turn entries. Lastly, radar, laser, and thermal WWD detection technologies were compared based on their WWD detections and false alarms. The laser sites had significantly more detections and false alarms than the radar sites (at $\\alpha = 0.05$), with the radar sites having a significantly higher WWD detection rate than false alarm rate. Radar false alarms were mainly caused by large trucks, whereas the laser sites had issues with equipment damage and traffic queues. The results of this paper can help agencies better understand WWD behavior and identify the most appropriate WWD detection technologies.","tags":["WWD","Regression"],"title":"Using Wrong-Way Driving Detection Data to Identify Factors That Affect Wrong-Way Driving Behavior and Compare Detection Technologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John McCombs","Haitham Al-Deek","Adrian Sandt","Grady Carrick","Nizam Uddin"],"categories":null,"content":"This presentation was sponsored by the Standing Committee on Traffic Law Enforcement (ACS30).

However, some states develop their own SPF methodologies due to data differences and a need for additional roadway categories. The Florida Department of Transportation has developed a context classification system that groups intersections into eight categories, allowing for the development of regional context-specific SPFs. To best utilize this system, safety engineers from departments of transportation (DOTs) across the United States were surveyed about their stateâ€™s current SPF development practices and context classification. Many states (64% of the 42 respondents) use HSM SPFs or SPFs calibrated to their jurisdiction. Although 62% of states had not heard of context classification, 67% of states expressed interest in it. One reason some states were not interested in using context classification was insufficient evidence of its benefits compared to the current HSM methodology. To showcase the increased accuracy of SPFs developed using this system, HSM SPFs [baseline, baseline with crash modification factors (CMFs), and calibrated with CMFs] for rural two-lane, two-way roads were compared with a context-specific SPF for C2T-Rural Town signalized four-leg intersections. These comparisons found that the HSM SPF with CMFs overpredicted crashes for Florida intersections (calibration factor of 0.87). The context-specific SPF better predicted total crashes, contained additional variables (including a regional variable), and performed statistically better than all three HSM SPFs. By implementing a similar context classification system, agencies could develop more accurate SPFs and identify regional differences, improving safety throughout their jurisdictions.","tags":["SPF","Regression"],"title":"Using context classification to develop intersection Safety Performance Functions: national survey of current practices and evaluation of benefits for rural Florida intersections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ghalia Gamaleldin","Haitham Al-Deek","Adrian Sandt","John McCombs"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622592000,"objectID":"0eceadcba2cb0fe20bfedd2f3eeff74a","permalink":"/publication/20210602jtss/","publishdate":"2021-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20210602jtss/","section":"publication","summary":"Safety performance functions (SPFs) are used to predict intersection crashes.

Two types of comparisons were used to evaluate the benefits of context-specific SPFs for the C3R-Suburban Residential and C4-Urban General context categories. First, individual intersection group SPFs were developed for unsignalized and signalized 3-leg and 4-leg intersection groups within each category. These individual SPFs were then compared to full category SPFs using data from all four intersection groups. The individual SPFs typically had lower performance measure values and more accurate crash predictions than the full SPFs while containing additional variables. For example, FDOT District 7 and major median were significant in several individual C3R SPFs but not in the full SPF. Next, comparisons were made between context-specific SPFs and HSM SPFs for two intersection groups (C3R signalized 4-leg and C4 unsignalized 3-leg). The context-specific SPFs outperformed the HSM SPFs in predicting multi-vehicle crashes, demonstrating the improved benefits that agencies can gain by developing context-specific SPFs.","tags":["SPF"],"title":"Evaluating the benefits of using a context classification system to develop intersection safety performance functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ghalia Gamaleldin","Haitham Al-Deek","Adrian Sandt","John McCombs","Alan El-Urfali"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619395200,"objectID":"efdb327eabe6a8e12909d3247c888f59","permalink":"/publication/20210426trr/","publishdate":"2021-04-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20210426trr/","section":"publication","summary":"Safety performance functions (SPFs) are essential tools to help agencies predict crashes and understand influential factors. Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has implemented a context classification system which classifies intersections into eight context categories rather than the three classifications used in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM). Using this system, regional SPFs could be developed for 32 intersection types (unsignalized and signalized 3-leg and 4-leg for each category) rather than the 10 HSM intersection types. In this paper, eight individual intersection group SPFs were developed for the C3R-Suburban Residential and C4-Urban General categories and compared with full SPFs for these categories. These comparisons illustrate the unique and regional insights that agencies can gain by developing these individual SPFs. Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated, and boosted regression tree models were developed for each studied group as appropriate, with the best model selected for each group based on model interpretability and five performance measures. Additionally, a linear regression model was built to predict minor roadway traffic volumes for intersections which were missing these volumes. The full C3R and C4 SPFs contained four and six significant variables, respectively, while the individual intersection group SPFs in these categories contained six and nine variables. Factors such as major median, intersection angle, and FDOT District 7 regional variable were absent from the full SPFs. By developing individual intersection group SPFs with regional factors, agencies can better understand the factors and regional differences which affect crashes in their jurisdictions and identify effective treatments.","tags":["SPF","Regression"],"title":"Regional Perspective of Safety Performance Functions and Their Application to Florida Intersections in Suburban Residential and Urban General Context Classification Categories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John McCombs","Haitham Al-Deek","Adrian Sandt","Ghalia Gamaleldin","Alan El-Urfali"],"categories":null,"content":"This presentation was sponsored by the Standing Committee on Regional Transportation Systems Management and Operations (ACP10).

Deploying intelligent transportation systems (ITS) WWD countermeasures at freeway exit ramps can effectively reduce WWD crash risk (WWCR), but these countermeasures are expensive. In this paper, a WWCR segment model and WWD countermeasures optimization algorithm are developed for all Florida limited access facilities (56 roadways with 1,375 exits) to identify the optimal locations for ITS countermeasure deployment. These were previously developed for specific toll-road networks within Florida, but never for a statewide network. Multiple WWCR models were investigated, with the final Poisson model using four-exit segments and 5 years of WWD event data. This model showed that more WWD events and higher crossing road traffic volumes increased WWCR, while certain interchange designs increased or decreased WWCR. Sixty-three segments containing 169 exit ramps without ITS WWD countermeasures were identified as WWD hotspots; these ramps were compared with the 169 ramps with the highest WWCR selected by the optimization algorithm. The algorithm selected 96 ramps not in the hotspots (improved resource utilization of 56.8%) and provided a 38.6% increase in WWCR reduction. Comparing WWD detection and turnaround data from 31 sites with rectangular flashing beacon ITS countermeasures to the optimization indicated a significant positive association between WWCR and turnaround percentage (higher WWCR at sites with lower turnaround percentage), verifying the accuracy of the optimization. By showing the transferability, scalability, accuracy, and benefits of this approach, this paper can help agencies reduce WWD and improve freeway safety and operations.","tags":["WWD","Optimization"],"title":"Statewide Application of Wrong-Way Driving Crash Risk Modeling and Countermeasures Optimization Algorithm to Identify Optimal Locations for Countermeasure Deployment on Florida Limited Access Facilities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ghalia Gamaleldin","Haitham Al-Deek","Adrian Sandt","John McCombs","Alan El-Urfali","Nizam Uddin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596412800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596412800,"objectID":"4cbcd20f7f197d661d1187415ad97536","permalink":"/publication/20200803jtss/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20200803jtss/","section":"publication","summary":"Safety performance functions (SPFs) are vital tools used to predict and reduce intersection crashes.

To develop these context-specific SPFs, data for 29 variables were collected based on the Model Inventory of Roadway Elements 2.0, allowing for standard data collection across agencies. A statistically significant linear regression model (adjusted $R\\^2=0.684$) was built to predict missing minor AADT volumes. ZINB models outperformed the other models for the two unsignalized intersection groups, whereas NB models performed the best for the two signalized intersection groups.
