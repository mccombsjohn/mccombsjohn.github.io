    abstract = { Network screening is a key aspect of the safety management process. The current standard methods in the Highway Safety Manual assume that intersections and roadway segments are independent, even though interactions between sites likely exist. One way to account for these interactions is by studying roadway corridors made of consecutive intersections and segments. This paper developed a roadway corridor definition to identify urban and suburban arterial corridors in Florida with context classification and lane count as defining features. Applying this definition to 10 Florida counties resulted in 1,105 corridors with 14,097 fatal or serious injury crashes from 2017 to 2021. Historic crashes and a developed regression model were used to estimate the expected crash frequency for fatal and serious injury crashes with the empirical Bayes method. After performing k-means clustering on expected crash frequency per mile, 25 high-risk corridors were identified. The difference between the expected and predicted crash frequencies (potential for safety improvement) for each high-risk corridor provided a list of priority corridors for safety improvements. Countermeasures focused on speed reduction in suburban corridors would likely lead to the greatest reductions in fatal and serious injury crashes. This corridor approach allows agencies to quickly identify high-risk areas for priority treatment. }
