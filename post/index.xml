      <description>&lt;p&gt;From February 2019 through February 2022, I was the President of the UCF Student Chapter of ITE.  For the 2020-2021 year, our chapter received the Student Chapter Momentum Award from the Florida Puerto Rico District of ITE (FLPRITE).  This award is designed to recognize a student chapter that has experienced the greatest momentum/improvement in the past year.  During the period, our membership increased from 5 members to 32 members, the largest growth the chapter has on record.  Our chapter also added more officer positions to help grow the club.  For more information, check out the annual report that I primarily authored that helped us win the award &lt;a href=&#34;/uploads/annualreport.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
